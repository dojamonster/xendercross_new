# Fault Report Management System - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**System-Based Approach**: Using a hybrid of Material Design and Fluent Design principles for data-heavy, workflow-oriented enterprise application. This approach prioritizes functionality, clear information hierarchy, and efficient task completion over decorative elements.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Primary: 220 85% 55% (Professional blue for headers, primary actions)
- Secondary: 220 15% 25% (Dark blue-gray for text, borders)

**Status Colors:**
- Success: 120 60% 45% (Green for "approved" status)
- Warning: 35 85% 55% (Orange for pending/in-progress)
- Info: 200 85% 60% (Light blue for informational tags)
- Neutral: 220 10% 95% (Light gray for backgrounds)

**Dark Mode:**
- Background: 220 15% 8%
- Surface: 220 12% 12%
- Text: 220 10% 90%

### B. Typography
**Font Stack:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- Headlines: 600 weight, 24px-32px
- Body text: 400 weight, 16px
- Labels/captions: 500 weight, 14px
- Buttons: 500 weight, 16px

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Tailwind units 2, 4, 6, 8, 12
- Card padding: p-6
- Section margins: mb-8
- Button spacing: px-4 py-2
- Grid gaps: gap-4 or gap-6

### D. Component Library

**Dashboard Layout:**
- Sidebar navigation with fault report categories
- Main content area with card-based report listings
- Status badges using pill-shaped design with appropriate status colors

**Forms:**
- Clean, single-column layout with generous spacing
- File upload with drag-and-drop visual feedback
- Form validation with inline error states

**Cards:**
- Elevated cards (shadow-md) for fault reports
- Hover states with subtle shadow increase
- Clear typography hierarchy within cards

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Solid blue buttons for main actions
- Secondary: Outline buttons with transparent backgrounds
- Status-specific: Colors matching the action (green for approve, orange for priority)

**Modal/Detail Views:**
- Full-screen overlay for detailed fault report view
- Two-column layout: report details left, actions right
- Clear visual separation between content sections

**Navigation:**
- Breadcrumb navigation for workflow steps
- Back buttons with clear labeling
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes

### E. Workflow-Specific Design

**Reports Dashboard:**
- List/grid toggle view
- Filter and search functionality
- Status tags prominently displayed
- Click-to-expand functionality

**Priority Selection:**
- Radio button group with clear visual distinction
- Time-based icons (clock, calendar) for each priority level
- Confirmation modal before submission

**Status Management:**
- Toast notifications for status changes
- Visual feedback during transitions
- Clear success/completion states

## Interaction Patterns
- Click-through workflows with clear next steps
- Confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions
- Loading states during backend operations
- Responsive feedback for all user actions

## Accessibility
- High contrast ratios for all text
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly labels
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements

## Images
No hero images required. This is a utility-focused enterprise application where imagery would be limited to:
- File attachment previews (thumbnails)
- Status icons (checkmarks, clocks, warning symbols)
- User profile avatars if applicable
- Document/report type icons

The focus should be on clean, efficient interfaces that facilitate quick task completion rather than visual storytelling.
